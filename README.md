# Rekrutation task

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Install the app

### `npm start`

Possible markers

### `{{ Name/.... }}`

### `{{ Value/.... }}`

## My conclusion of solution

If I type characters by hand, it works fine for two kinds of markers. If I paste content with only Name marker, then also is correct.
In the case below, it is also OK:

In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold. Like {{ Name/BTC }} and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, {{ Name/BITGOLD }}) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a reusable proof of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo.
The first decentralized cryptocurrency, {{ Name/BTC }}, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, {{ Name/NMC }} was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, {{ Name/LTC }} was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, {{ Name/PPC }} was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.
{{ Value/BTC }} {{ Value/GBP }} {{ Value/BOB }}

Unfortunately, when pasting mixed content, there is often a BUG :(
